Household surveys include a series of questions to measure modern contraceptive prevalence rate and demand for family planning. Total demand for family planning is defined as the sum of the number of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who are married or in a union and who are currently using, or whose sexual partner is currently using, at least one contraceptive method, and the unmet need for family planning. Unmet need for family planning is the proportion of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) either married or in a consensual union, who are fecund and sexually active but who are not using any method of contraception (modern or traditional), and report not wanting any more children or wanting to delay the birth of their next child for at least two years. Included are: (i) all pregnant women (married or in a consensual union) whose pregnancies were unwanted or mistimed at the time of conception; (ii) all postpartum amenorrhoeic women (married or in consensual union) who are not using family planning and whose last birth was unwanted or mistimed; (iii) all fecund women (married or in consensual union) who are neither pregnant nor postpartum amenorrhoeic, and who either do not want any more children (want to limit family size), or who wish to postpone the birth of a child for at least two years or do not know when or if they want another child (want to space births), but are not using any contraceptive method.","SDG_GOAL":"Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages","SDG_TARGET":"By 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes","SDG_INDICATOR":"Proportion of women of reproductive age (aged 15\u201349 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods","methodology_national":"","DATA_SOURCE":"","COVERAGE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"","COMPARABILITY":"","methodology_start_date":"","indicator_introduction_plan":"","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Monstat","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-08-03","national_data_updated_date":"2022-10-24","target_number":"3.7","goal_number":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-07-01"}
