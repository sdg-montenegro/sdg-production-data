It is also referred to as the age-specific fertility rate for women aged 15\uf02d19 years. The adolescent birth rate is generally computed as a ratio. The numerator is the number of live births to women aged 15\uf02d19 years, and the denominator is an estimate of exposure to childbearing by women aged 15\uf02d19 years. The numerator and the denominator are calculated differently for civil registration and survey and census data.","SDG_GOAL":"Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages","SDG_TARGET":"By 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes","SDG_INDICATOR":"Adolescent birth rate (aged 10\u201314 years; aged 15\u201319 years) per 1,000 women in that age group","methodology_national":"","DATA_SOURCE":"","COVERAGE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"","COMPARABILITY":"","methodology_start_date":"","indicator_introduction_plan":"","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Monstat","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-08-03","target_number":"3.7","goal_number":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-07-02"}
