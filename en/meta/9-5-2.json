Concepts: The OECD Frascati Manual (OECD, 2015) provides the relevant definitions for research and experimental development, gross domestic expenditure on R&D and researchers. Although an OECD manual, the application is global. During the 6th revision of the Frascati Manual, developing country issues were mainstreamed in the core of the Manual. The 7th edition was released in October 2015. The following definitions, taken from the 2015 edition of the Frascati Manual are relevant for computing the indicator. Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative and systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge - including knowledge of humankind, culture and society - and to devise new applications of available knowledge. Researchers are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge. They conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques instrumentation, software or operational methods.The Full-time equivalent (FTE) of R&D personnel is defined as the ratio of working hours actually spent on R&D during a specific reference period (usually a calendar year) divided by the total number of hours conventionally worked in the same period by an individual or by a group. Computation Method: Computation of the indicator Researchers (in full-time equivalent) per million inhabitants uses  available population data as denominator.","SDG_GOAL":"Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation","SDG_TARGET":"Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries, including, by 2030, encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and development workers per 1 million people and public and private research and development spending","SDG_INDICATOR":"Researchers (in full-time equivalent) per million inhabitants","methodology_national":"","DATA_SOURCE":"","COVERAGE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"","COMPARABILITY":"","methodology_start_date":"","indicator_introduction_plan":"","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Science in Montenegro","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-08-09","national_data_updated_date":"2023-07-11","target_number":"9.5","goal_number":"9","indicator_sort_order":"09-05-02"}
