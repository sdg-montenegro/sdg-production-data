It is calculated as direct imports (IM) of material plus domestic extraction (DE) of materials minus direct exports (EX) of materials measured in metric tonnes. DMC measures the amount of materials that are used in economic processes. It does not include materials that are mobilized the process of domestic extraction but do not enter the economic process. DMC is based on official economic statistics and it requires some modelling to adapt the source data to the methodological requirements of the MFA. The accounting standard and accounting methods are set out in the EUROSTAT guidebooks for MFA accounts in the latest edition of 2013. MFA accounting is also part of the central framework of the System of integrated Environmental-Economic Accounts (SEEA).","SDG_GOAL":"Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all","SDG_TARGET":"Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation, in accordance with the 10\u2010Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production, with developed countries taking the lead","SDG_INDICATOR":"Domestic material consumption, domestic material consumption per capita, and domestic material consumption per GDP","methodology_national":"","DATA_SOURCE":"","COVERAGE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"","COMPARABILITY":"","methodology_start_date":"","indicator_introduction_plan":"","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Monstat","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-08-03","national_data_updated_date":"2023-07-09","target_number":"8.4","goal_number":"8","indicator_sort_order":"08-04-02"}
