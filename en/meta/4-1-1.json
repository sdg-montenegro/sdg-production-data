Computation method: The indicator is calculated as the number of children and young people at the relevant stage of education achieving or exceeding a pre-defined proficiency level in the given subject. Performance above the minimum level, PLtn,s,above minimum = p, where p is the percentage of students in a learning assessment at stage of education n, in subject s in any year (t-i) where 0 ? i ? 5, who has achieved the level of proficiency that is greater than a pre-defined minimum standard, Smin. The minimum standard is defined by the global education community taking into consideration regional differences.","SDG_GOAL":"Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all","SDG_TARGET":"By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes","SDG_INDICATOR":"Proportion of children and young people (a) in grades 2/3; (b) at the end of primary; and (c) at the end of lower secondary achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics, by sex","methodology_national":"","DATA_SOURCE":"","COVERAGE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"","COMPARABILITY":"","methodology_start_date":"","indicator_introduction_plan":"","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Education in Montenegro","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-08-09","national_data_updated_date":"2023-07-11","target_number":"4.1","goal_number":"4","indicator_sort_order":"04-01-01"}
