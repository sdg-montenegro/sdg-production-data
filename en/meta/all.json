Total final consumption of energy is calculated from national balances and statistics as total final consumption minus non-energy use. Renewable energy consumption is derived from three tables of the IEA world energy statistics and balances: total final consumption, electricity output and heat output. All volumes reported in the total final consumption table are taken as reported. Since volumes for electricity and heat in the final consumption table are not broken down by technology, electricity and heat output tables are used instead to break down final consumption of electricity and heat by technology. The allocation by technology is done by deriving the share of technology in electricity and heat output tables and multiplying that share by final energy consumption of electricity and heat,

In the context of the SDG agenda, the dataset is expanded to physicians, nursing personnel, midwifery personnel, dentistry personnel and pharmaceutical personnel. The dataset is planned to progressively move to cover all health cadres. The method of estimation for number of physicians (including generalist and specialist medical practitioners) depending on the nature of the original data source may include practising physicians only or all registered physicians. The figures for number of nursing and midwifery include nursing personnel and midwifery personnel, whenever available. In many countries, nurses trained with midwifery skills are counted and reported as nurses. This makes the distinction between nursing personnel and midwifery personnel difficult to draw. The figures for number of dentistry personnel include dentists, dental technicians/assistants and related occupations. Due to variability of data sources, the professional-level and associate-level occupations may not always be distinguishable. The figures for number of pharmaceutical personnel include pharmacists, pharmaceutical technicians/assistants and related occupations. Due to variability of data sources, the professionallevel and associate-level occupations may not always be distinguishable. In general, the denominator data for workforce density (i.e. national population estimates) are obtained from the United Nations Population Division's World Population Prospects database. In cases where the official health workforce report provides density indicators instead of counts, estimates of the stock were then calculated using the population estimated from the United Nations Population Division's World population prospects database (2015).","SDG_GOAL":"Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages","SDG_TARGET":"Substantially increase health financing and the recruitment, development, training and retention of the health workforce in developing countries, especially in least developed countries and small island developing States","SDG_INDICATOR":"Health worker density and distribution","methodology_national":"","DATA_SOURCE":"","COVERAGE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"","COMPARABILITY":"","methodology_start_date":"","indicator_introduction_plan":"","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Institute for Public Health in Montenegro","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-08-03","national_data_updated_date":"2023-07-11","target_number":"3.c","goal_number":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-0c-01"},"8-5-2":{"data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_title":"Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities","indicator_number":"8.5.2","national_geographical_coverage":"Montenegro","reporting_status":"complete","standalone":false,"SDG_GOAL__GLOBAL":"Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all","SDG_TARGET__GLOBAL":"By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value","SDG_INDICATOR__GLOBAL":"Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities","methodology_global":"The unemployment rate conveys the percentage of persons in the labour force who are unemployed.

The goal of this indicator aims to generate the proportion of municipal solid waste regularly collected and that is adequately treated and disposed out of all the total municipal waste generated by the city. Concepts: It will be necessary to define the following components to compute the proportion of municipal solid waste regularly collected with adequate treatment and disposal out of all the total municipal solid waste generated by the city: Municipal Solid Waste, Regularly Collected Municipal Solid Waste, Uncollected Municipal Solid Waste, Total Municipal Solid Waste Generated by the City, Municipal Solid Waste with Adequate Final Treatment and Disposal. Computation Method: The numerator of this indicator is 'municipal solid waste regularly collected with adequate final treatment and disposal' and the denominator is 'total municipal solid waste generated by the city' multiplied by 100. Multiplication of the municipal solid waste generation per capita and population of the city can estimate total municipal solid waste generated by the city. When the municipal solid waste generation per capita is not available, household survey for a daily waste generation in household and other premises (e.g. restaurants, hotels, hospitals, schools, etc.) should be conducted. Since the waste generation can differ according to the seasons, the survey should be conducted at least two times a year to estimate the municipal solid waste generation per capita. Municipal solid waste regularly collected with adequate final treatment and disposal is estimated through qualitative judgement of the degree of environmental control of facilities where the city's municipal waste is collected and transported. The judgement of environmental control can be conducted in line with the criteria below. Another important thing is to deduct residue amount from treatment facilities to avoid double count.","SDG_GOAL":"Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable","SDG_TARGET":"By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management","SDG_INDICATOR":"Proportion of municipal solid waste collected and managed in controlled facilities out of total municipal waste generated, by cities","methodology_national":"","DATA_SOURCE":"","COVERAGE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"","COMPARABILITY":"","methodology_start_date":"","indicator_introduction_plan":"","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Economy and Tourism in Montenegro","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-08-09","national_data_updated_date":"2023-07-11","target_number":"11.6","goal_number":"11","indicator_sort_order":"11-06-01"},"17-10-1":{"computation_units":"millions USD (2017)","data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_title":"Worldwide weighted tariff-average","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Worldwide weighted tariff-average","indicator_number":"17.10.1","national_geographical_coverage":"Montenegro","precision":[{"unit":"millions USD (2017)"},{"decimals":2}],"reporting_status":"complete","standalone":false,"SDG_GOAL__GLOBAL":"Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development","SDG_TARGET__GLOBAL":"Promote a universal, rules-based, open, non\u2010discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organization, including through the conclusion of negotiations under its Doha Development Agenda","SDG_INDICATOR__GLOBAL":"Worldwide weighted tariff-average","methodology_global":"","SDG_GOAL":"Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development","SDG_TARGET":"Promote a universal, rules-based, open, non\u2010discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organization, including through the conclusion of negotiations under its Doha Development Agenda","SDG_INDICATOR":"Worldwide weighted tariff-average","methodology_national":"","DATA_SOURCE":"UNECE: https://w3.unece.org/SDG/","COVERAGE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"Data were collected until May 1, 2023.","COMPARABILITY":"","methodology_start_date":"","indicator_introduction_plan":"","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-07-10","national_data_updated_date":"2023-07-10","target_number":"17.10","goal_number":"17","indicator_sort_order":"17-10-01"},"3-3-3":{"data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_title":"Malaria incidence per 1,000 population","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Malaria incidence per 1,000 population","indicator_number":"3.3.3","national_geographical_coverage":"Montenegro","reporting_status":"complete","standalone":false,"SDG_GOAL__GLOBAL":"Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages","SDG_TARGET__GLOBAL":"By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases","SDG_INDICATOR__GLOBAL":"Malaria incidence per 1,000 population","methodology_global":"Incidence of malaria is defined as the number of new cases of malaria per 1,000 people at risk each year.

More specifically, the country estimates what is the proportion at high risk (H) and what is the proportion at low risk (L) and the population at risk is estimated as UN Population * H + UN population * L/2. The number of new cases, M, is estimated from the number of malaria cases reported by a Ministry of Health which is adjusted to take into account (i) incompleteness in reporting systems (ii) patients seeking treatment in the private sector, self-medicating or not seeking treatment at all, and (iii) potential overdiagnosis through the lack of laboratory confirmation of cases.

real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is calculated as the percentage change in the real GDP per capita between two consecutive years. Real GDP per capita is calculated by dividing GDP at constant prices by the population of a country or area. The data for real GDP are measured in constant US dollars to facilitate the calculation of country growth rates and aggregation of the country data. Computation Method: The annual growth rate of real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is calculated as follows: a. Convert annual real GDP in domestic currency at 2005 prices for a country or area to US dollars at 2005 prices using the 2005 exchange rates. b. Divide the result by the population of the country or area to obtain annual real GDP per capita in constant US dollars at 2005 prices. c. Calculate the annual growth rate of real GDP per capita in year t+ 1 using the following formula: [(G(t+1) - G(t))/G(t)] x 100%, where G(t+1) is real GDP per capita in 2005 US dollars in year t+1 and G(t) is real GDP per capita in 2005 US dollars in year t.","SDG_GOAL":"Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all","SDG_TARGET":"Sustain per capita economic growth in accordance with national circumstances and, in particular, at least 7 per cent gross domestic product growth per annum in the least developed countries","SDG_INDICATOR":"Annual growth rate of real GDP per capita","methodology_national":"","DATA_SOURCE":"","COVERAGE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"","COMPARABILITY":"","methodology_start_date":"","indicator_introduction_plan":"","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Monstat","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-08-03","national_data_updated_date":"2023-07-11","target_number":"8.1","goal_number":"8","indicator_sort_order":"08-01-01"},"9-4-1":{"data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_title":"CO2 emission per unit of value added","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_name":"CO2 emission per unit of value added","indicator_number":"9.4.1","national_geographical_coverage":"Montenegro","reporting_status":"complete","standalone":false,"SDG_GOAL__GLOBAL":"Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation","SDG_TARGET__GLOBAL":"By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities","SDG_INDICATOR__GLOBAL":"CO2 emission per unit of value added","methodology_global":"","SDG_GOAL":"Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation","SDG_TARGET":"By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities","SDG_INDICATOR":"CO2 emission per unit of value added","methodology_national":"","DATA_SOURCE":"MICS","COVERAGE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"","COMPARABILITY":"","methodology_start_date":"","indicator_introduction_plan":"","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Monstat","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-10-26","national_data_updated_date":"2022-10-26","target_number":"9.4","goal_number":"9","indicator_sort_order":"09-04-01"},"16-6-1":{"data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_title":"Primary government expenditures as a proportion of original approved budget, by sector (or by budget codes or similar)","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Primary government expenditures as a proportion of original approved budget, by sector (or by budget codes or similar)","indicator_number":"16.6.1","national_geographical_coverage":"Montenegro","reporting_status":"complete","standalone":false,"SDG_GOAL__GLOBAL":"Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels","SDG_TARGET__GLOBAL":"Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels","SDG_INDICATOR__GLOBAL":"Primary government expenditures as a proportion of original approved budget, by sector (or by budget codes or similar)","methodology_global":"Definition: Primary government expenditures as a proportion of original approved budget This indicator measures the extent to which aggregate budget expenditure outturn reflects the amount originally approved, as defined in government budget documentation and fiscal reports.

per million inhabitants is a direct measure of the number of research and development workers per 1 million people. Concepts: The OECD Frascati Manual (OECD, 2015) provides the relevant definitions for research and experimental development, gross domestic expenditure on R&D and researchers. Although an OECD manual, the application is global. During the 6th revision of the Frascati Manual, developing country issues were mainstreamed in the core of the Manual. The 7th edition was released in October 2015. The following definitions, taken from the 2015 edition of the Frascati Manual are relevant for computing the indicator. Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative and systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge - including knowledge of humankind, culture and society - and to devise new applications of available knowledge. Researchers are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge. They conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques instrumentation, software or operational methods.The Full-time equivalent (FTE) of R&D personnel is defined as the ratio of working hours actually spent on R&D during a specific reference period (usually a calendar year) divided by the total number of hours conventionally worked in the same period by an individual or by a group. Computation Method: Computation of the indicator Researchers (in full-time equivalent) per million inhabitants uses  available population data as denominator.","SDG_GOAL":"Build resilient
